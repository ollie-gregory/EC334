    "text": "Firm heterogeneity in data\n\nWhere does heterogeneity data come from?\n\nMost data on firm heterogeneity comes from accounting data:\n\nFlow variables such as sales, wage bill, inputs, profits come from the income statement.\nStocks such as assets (for measuring capital) and debt come from the balance sheet.\nThis is complemented with other micro data.\n\nPrices from surveys, scanner data and customs records.\nEmployment data from tax records or social security files.\nFirm-to-firm transactions data from VAT registries.\n\n\nResearchers can access this data in two ways:\n\nTax or census offices who make data available to accredited/sworn researchers.\nCommercial providers who collect regulatory financial data submissions.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of stylised facts\nMost economic activity comes from the largest firms.\n\n\n92% of firms have less than 20 employees.\n10% of firms are responsible for over 80% of employment.\n92% of firms are responsible for only just over 11% of sales.\n\nFirm size distribution is highly skewed and fat tailed.\n\nWhat is the cumulative distribution function of a Pareto distribution? \\[\n  P(X&lt;x) \\equiv F(x) = 1- \\left(\\frac{x}{x_m}\\right)^{-\\alpha}\n  \\] where \\(x_m\\) is the scale parameter and \\(\\alpha\\) is the shape parameter. \\(\\alpha\\) determines how fat the tail of the distribution is.\nWhat is the probability density function of a Pareto distribution? \\[\n  P(X=x) \\equiv f(x) = \\frac{\\alpha}{x_m}\\left(\\frac{x}{x_m}\\right)^{-\\alpha - 1}\n  \\] The PDF is a log-linear function meaning that if we apply a log transformation to it, it becomes a linear function.\n\\[\n  \\begin{split}\n  \\log(f(x)) &= \\log(\\alpha) - \\log(x_m) + (-\\alpha - 1)(\\log(x) - \\log(x_m))\\\\\n  &= \\log(\\alpha) + \\alpha \\log(x_m) -(1+\\alpha)\\log(x)\\\\\n  &=\\phi - (1+\\alpha)\\log(x) \\text{ where } \\phi = \\log(\\alpha) + \\alpha \\log(x_m)\n  \\end{split}\n  \\]\nThis means that we easily estimate the parameters of our distribution using OLS.\n\nEstimating firm size distribution\n\n\nHere we are regressing the log of what fraction of firms have a given number of employees on the log of the number of employees. If it is a clear linear fit, then the distribution is Pareto.\nWhy is it important that the distribution of firm size is fat tailed?\n\nFat tail means large firms are much more common than with a normal distribution.\nThese firms can have non-negligible effects on macroeconomy.\n\nLarge firms have market power and can extract profits.\nLarge firms may also be responsible for some business cycles.\n\nExtreme example: in 2000, Nokia caused Finnish GDP to grow by 1.6%.\n\n\n\nProductivity is highly dispersed even among firms in narrow industries.\n\nProductivity heterogeneity is a potential driver of firm heterogeneity: \\[\n  Y_{ijt} = \\textcolor{red}{A_{ijt}} \\times F(K_{ijt}, L_{ijt},M_{ijt})\n  \\]\nThis is because more productive firms can produce higher output for the same amount of inputs.\n\nLower marginal costs \\(\\rightarrow\\) lower prices \\(\\rightarrow\\) more demand and more inputs.\nThis means we would expect more productive firms to be larger.\n\nAs firm size is so dispersed, we would therefore expect that productivity across those firms is also very dispersed.\nHow can we measure productivity? To measure productivity, we have to assume a production function, in this case, cobb-douglas: \\[\n  y_{ijt} = a_{ijt} + \\alpha^K k_{ijt} + \\alpha^Ll_{ijt} + \\alpha^Mm_{ijt}\n  \\]\nHowever, we can’t just use OLS on this as the residual is productivity which would created omitted variable bias from being correlated with \\(k,l,\\) and \\(m\\). We instead have to use an instrumental variables approach.\nProductivity dispersion in data \nThis graph shows the yearly deviation from average TFP for both low density markets and high density markets.\n\nFirms at the 85th percentile of productivity tend to be 2 to 4 times more productive than those at the 15th percentile.\nThis dispersion of productivity can even be seen in narrow industries (in the US).",

    "text": "Recent trends in firm heterogeneity\n\nWhat trends can we see in the last 20 years of data on firm heterogeneity?\n\nSize (as measured through employment or sales) — there has been an increase in product-market concentration, ie, largest firms are getting larger.\nProductivity — overall productivity growth has slowed down, but the largest firms productivity growth has remained high.\nProfitability and market power — average markup of prices over marginal costs has increased. This has been driven by increases in markups at the highest percentiles of the distribution and coincides with a decline in the labour share of national income.\n\n\n\nWhat are two measures of market concentration?\n\nTraditional measure: Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI).\n\\[\n\\text{HHI}_{jt} = \\sum_{i \\in I_j} \\left(\\frac{py_{ijt}}{PY_{jt}}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\n\\(0\\) under perfect competition, \\(1\\) in monopoly and convex in between.\nOften used in antitrust guidelines (\\(0.18\\) FTC threshold in the US).\nThe downside is that it requires data from all firms which may not be readily available.\n\nNew common measure: Concentration Ratio.\n\\[\n\\text{CR}_{jt}^X = \\sum_{i=1}^X\\left(\\frac{py_{ijt}}{PY_{jt}}\\right)\n\\]\n\nShare of largest \\(X\\) firms in the industry.\nOnly requires data on the largest firms and the sector’s output.\n\n\n\n\nHow has market concentration changed?\n\n\n\n\nOverall market concentration has increased but sales concentration rose faster than employment concentration.\n\nSales, \\(P_{ijt}\\times Y_{ijt}\\), can increase because of changes in output OR prices.\n\\[\n  \\begin{split}\n  Y_{ijt} &= \\textcolor{red}{A_{ijt}}\\times F(K_{ijt},L_{ijt}, M_{ijt}) \\\\\n  P_{ijt} &= \\text{MC}_{ijt} \\times \\textcolor{red}{\\mu_{ijt}}\n  \\end{split}\n  \\]\n\nFirms might have an increase in sales due to being more productive, but it could also be due to them charging higher prices and having a greater markup (\\(\\mu_{ijt}\\)) on their marginal costs (\\(\\text{MC}_{ijt}\\)).\n\\(A_{ijt}\\) represents the firm’s technology which affects how efficiently they can produce.\n\\(\\mu_{ijt}\\) represents their market power — firms with lots of market power can have higher markups on their marginal costs.\n\n\n\n\nHow has productivity changed?\n\n\n\nIn the US, productivity growth has slowed since the early 2000s.\nIn France, productivity has actually been trending downwards since the 2000s.\n\n\n\nThe productivity of initially more productive firms in 2000 has increased since 2000 while the least productive firms have seen no real change in productivity.\nThis could be one explanation for the increase in industry concentration.\n\n\n\nHow can we measure market power?\n\\[\n\\mu_{ijt} = \\frac{P_{ijt}}{\\text{MC}_{ijt}}\n\\]\nThe markup of price over marginal cost is the purest measure of market power.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, the markup should be \\(1\\).\nA markup of more than \\(1\\), indicates that the firm has some market power.\n\nIn practice, the markup is often greater than \\(1\\) because firms have fixed costs to cover or R&D expenses to recuperate.\nHowever, it can also be due to having greater market power through high barriers to entry for example.\n\n\n\n\nHow have markups changed?\n\n\n\nAverage markup of US listed firms.\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage markup by percentile.\n\n\n\nAverage markups have increased a lot since the 1980s from just over 1 in 1980 to over 1.5 since 2010.\nThere has also been a large increase in markup dispersion since the 1980s, with the largest firms increasing their markup by a significant amount while the smaller firms have kept their markup broadly the same.\n\nThis suggests the increase in average markup is driven by an increase in markups of the largest firms.\n\n\n\n\nHow has the labour share of national income changed?\n\n\nDespite firms charging a lot more money for their products, the share of national income that is paid in wages to workers has decreased significantly since the early 2000s.",

The next stage is to expand the square on the left hand side, which we do using the following formula:\n\\[\n  \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^N x_k\\right)^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^N x_k \\times \\sum_{j=1}^N x_j = \\sum_{k=1}^N \\sum_{j=1}^N x_k  x_j\n  \\]\nWhen we apply this to the expression inside the expectation term, we get,\n\\[\n  \\left( \\sum_{k \\in K}\\frac{a_{k,t-1}}{Y_{t-1}} \\sigma_k \\epsilon_{k,t} \\right)^2 =  \\sum_{j \\in J}\\sum_{k \\in K}\\frac{a_{k,t-1}}{Y_{t-1}} \\sigma_k \\epsilon_{k,t} \\frac{a_{j,t-1}}{Y_{t-1}} \\sigma_j \\epsilon_{j,t}\n  \\]\nUsing the fact that \\(\\epsilon_{k,t}\\) has mean zero, along with the fact that \\(\\mathbb{E}[X+Y] = \\mathbb{E}[X] + \\mathbb{E}[Y]\\), we can therefore reduce the left hand side of this whole expression to,\n\\[\n  \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{k\\in K} \\sigma_k^2\\epsilon_{k,t}^2\\left[\\frac{a_{k,t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}\\right]^2\\right]\n  \\]\nThis is because all of the terms where \\(k \\neq j\\), take the expectation of different \\(\\epsilon_{k,t}\\) meaning that the overall expectation of those terms is \\(0\\), leaving only the terms were \\(k = j\\).\nWe now use two more rules of expectations which are that the expectation of a constant is the constant, \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda] = \\lambda\\), and that the expectation of a product is equal to the product of expectations, \\(\\mathbb{E}[XY] = \\mathbb{E}[X]\\mathbb{E}[Y]\\).\n\\[\n  \\begin{split}\n  \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{k\\in K} \\sigma_k^2\\left[\\frac{a_{k,t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}\\right]^2\\right]\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{k,t}^2] &= \\left[\\sum_{k\\in K} \\sigma_k^2\\left[\\frac{a_{k,t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}\\right]^2\\right](\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{k,t}^2] + \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{k,t}]^2)\\\\\n  &= \\left[\\sum_{k\\in K} \\sigma_k^2\\left[\\frac{a_{k,t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}\\right]^2\\right]\\text{var}(\\epsilon_{k,t})\n  \\\\\n  &=\\sum_{k\\in K} \\sigma_k^2\\left[\\frac{a_{k,t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}\\right]^2\n  \\end{split}\n  \\]\nThis once again uses the fact that \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{k,t}] = 0\\) and therefore adds \\(0\\) to the term \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{k,t}^2]\\) and allows us to use the formula for the variance. This is useful because we know that the variance of \\(\\epsilon_{k,t}\\) is \\(1\\). All that is left therefore is to take the square root to arrive at the standard deviation for GDP growth.\n\\[\n  \\sigma_Y = \\left(\\sum_{k \\in K}\\sigma_k^2\\left[\\frac{a_{k,t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}\\right]^2\\right)^{\\frac12}\n  \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical assumption\n\n\n\nAssume that all firms/production entities have the same volatility and size.\n\n\nThis reduces the volatility of GDP growth to,\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\sigma_Y &= \\left(\\sum_{k \\in K}\\sigma_k^2\\left[\\frac{a_{k,t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}\\right]^2\\right)^{\\frac12}\\\\\n&= \\left(\\sum_{k \\in K}\\sigma_k^2\\left[\\frac{1}{N}\\right]^2\\right)^{\\frac12}\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}} \\text{ where } N = |K|\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\nEmpirically, \\(N\\) is large, so the effect of idiosyncratic shocks is very small.\n\nIndividual shocks average out to \\(0\\).\nFor example, across 473 NAICS manufacturing industries, the average volatility is 9% \\((\\sigma = 0.09)\\).\n\\[\n  \\hat{\\sigma}_Y = \\frac{0.009}{\\sqrt{473}} = 0.0041\n  \\]\n\nThis means that according to this model, idiosyncratic shocks cause a volatility of 0.41% while in reality, the GDP volatility of the manufacturing industry is 3%.",

    "text": "Hulten’s theorem\n\nWhat is GDP?\nSo far, we have defined GDP as the sum of i.i.d. outputs \\(a\\). This is because in macroeconomics, we typically think of an aggregate production function \\(Y = AF(K,L)\\). However, at the micro level, there are many ‘production recipes’:\n\\[\nY_i = A_i F(K_i, L_i, \\textcolor{red}{M_i})\n\\]\nwhere \\(M_i\\) represents intermediate inputs. These intermediate inputs introduce a source of shock propagation for micro shocks to affect the macro economy.\n\n\nWhat is Hulten’s Theorem (1978)?\nConsider an efficient economy, meaning that welfare theorems apply. Then, under minimal assumptions, the following holds:\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\log(Y)}{d \\log(z_i)} = \\lambda_i\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\lambda_i\\) is a firm or sector’s Domar weight:\n\\[\n\\lambda_i = \\frac{p_iy_i}{\\text{GDP}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomar weights\n\n\n\nThe sum of all Domar weights should be greater than one because GDP represents value added, but firms use a lot of intermediate goods in their production, i.e., firm output is not the same as firm value added.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the derivation for Hulten’s theorem?\nWhat is the model environment\n\nThe economy consists of \\(n\\) competitive firms/industries.\nEach industry produces using,\n\n\\(n\\) intermediate inputs.\n\\(m\\) primary factors.\n\nThe production function has constant returns to scale and can be made up of any combination of inputs.\n\\[\n  y_i = z_if(x_{i1},...,x_{in};I_{i1},..., I_{im})\n  \\]\nA representative household has preferences over all goods.\n\\[\n  Y = u(c_1,...,c_n)\n  \\]\n\nThis is also homogeneous of degree 1, meaning that multiplying all inputs by a constant, has the effect of multiplying the output by the same constant.\n\nOf a firms output \\(y_i\\), \\(c_i\\) of it is consumed as final goods, and \\(x_i\\) is used as intermediate goods.\nHouseholds are endowed with \\(h_k\\) units of primary good \\(k\\).\n\nAs the welfare theorems hold, we can analyse this from the social planner’s perspective in order to simplify the problem.\nWhat is the social planner’s problem?\nThe social planner chooses consumption, factor, and intermediate usage to maximise utility.\n\\[\nY = \\max_{c_i, I_{ik}, x_{ij}} u(c_1,...,c_n) \\text{ s.t.}\n\\] \\[\nc_i + \\sum_{j=1}^n x_{ji} = z_i f(x_{i1},...,x_{in};
